Codes in this folder are used to evaluate the unsupervised clustering.

"area_processes.csv" shows the manually labelled results.

"first_eveluation_clustering.m" is firstly used to evaluate the similarity between the clustering results by using different feature sets. 
"evaluation_clustering.py" is afterwards used to 
summarize the evaluation results.

"evaluation_c2_indetical areas.py" could be used to evaluate the similarity of the clustering results between different cortical locations.
